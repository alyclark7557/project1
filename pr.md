What did you like about this website?
    This website is very easy to read - Text section headers are large and concise enough to make it obvious to visitors what the content is. Coming to this site as a fresh visitor, there is nothing that I could think of about the club that I couldn’t find on the site, so in that sense, I believe it’s very well organized and covers all the bases.
Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    One significant difference is that my site’s content will resize to become larger and smaller before changing the layout of the site while this site sizes content appropriately to where the resizing of the viewport maintains readability and avoids having to adjust the sizes of different content.
Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think this site has a better user experience, as I believe on my site, resizing the content to too small a window reduces functionality, while this site maintains full functionality at most reasonable viewports.
Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I believe my codebase would be more maintainable right now, as the theme of my site demands more visual content than informational at times, therefore I’ve already structured a lot of my images in subdirectories past /images to better facilitate organization of content.
Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories? If not, suggest some specific improvements
    Code is well structured within files, with clean spacing and element organization that is easy to match with how the content appears on the site. Organization between files and directories is good, with external stylesheets, separate directories for stylesheets and images, and well named files that correctly match the content they provide.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
were semantically appropriate elements selected
    In some places, the author uses divs with ids instead of html elements that match the content (for example: nav and .navbar).
is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes, and it does so well.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    I think having certain content resize to larger would be helpful, since some higher resolution monitors might not help.
