            Reasons Why I Fit the Requirements:
            <li>I created a website for a club which means that I have a target audience of people who enjoy board games. This allows me to think empathetically because it isn't explicitly for my use</li>
            <li>None of this content is from other sites</li>
            <li>I have a navbar at the top of every page that allows navigation between pages.</li>
            <li>Each page serves an important purpose for the club. The exec page allows prospective members to meet exec, calendar is for events, news and updates is for club changes and exciting news, and contact is for the people who want to talk to us</li>
            <li>I gave each photo an alt tag that accurately described what is pictured</li>
            <li>I used several font faces throughout the different pages.</li>
            <li>I have a footer animation that leads to this documentation</li>
            <li>I have been working on this and pushing for this project consistently
            </li>
