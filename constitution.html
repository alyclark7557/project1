            Article VIII - Hazing <br>
            
            “The Board Game Club”, in keeping with JMU’s expectations for a positive academic and social environment, unconditionally opposes hazing. No individual member of our group or the group itself may engage in or plan any activity that may be defined as hazing.<br>
            
             “The Board Game Club” opposes any situation created intentionally to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule to its members or potential members. In addition, no individual nor recognized organization may by physical or mental stress or by subtle or covert technique, impair, make captive, or destroy an individuals’ freedom of thought and choice.<br>
            
            
            J17-100 Hazing The university prohibits any situation created intentionally to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule in connection with or the purpose of initiation, admission into, or affiliation with or as a condition for continued membership in a club, organization, or association, regardless of whether the students participated voluntarily in the relevant activity. Students directing, engaging in, aiding, or participating in, actively or passively, the forcing, compelling, requiring, encouraging, expecting, whether direct or implied, of individuals to participate in hazing activities shall be considered in violation of this policy. It is impossible to anticipate every situation that could involve hazing. Behavior listed below does not, and cannot encompass every circumstance that can be categorized as hazing. Further, this policy is not intended to prohibit customary athletic events, contests, and competitions that are sponsored by the institution or the organized and supervised practices associated with such events or activity or conduct that furthers the goals of a legitimate educational curriculum, extracurricular program, or military training program as approved by the University.<br>
            Hazing activities include but are not limited to; physical abuse; kidnapping, blindfolding, confinement, or binding and/or restricting movement; calisthenics or other strenuous physical activity used to harass, punish, or harm an individual; excursions; spraying, painting, or pelting with any substance; burying in any substance; nudity; servitude; exposure to uncomfortable elements; verbal abuse or harassment; wearing of apparel which is conspicuous or indecent; forcing consumption of any legal or illegal substance (e.g. food, liquid, beverage, alcohol, drug, or other substance); depriving of sufficient sleep; burning, branding, or tattooing; interrogation in an intimidating or threatening manner; misleading members in an effort to convince them that they will not become or remain members unless they complete tasks, follow instructions, or act in a certain way; misleading members into believing that they will be hurt during induction or initiation; carrying items that serve no constructive purpose or that are designed to punish or embarrass the carrier; requiring or suggesting obtaining, possessing items or completing tasks in an unlawful manner (i.e. scavenger hunts); any act that is designed to or likely to compromise the dignity of a member or prospective member, cause embarrassment or shame to a member or prospective member, cause a member or prospective member to be the object of malicious amusement, ridicule, or emotional strain, or cause psychological harm or substantial emotional strain; or any other activity which may result in physical injury or endanger the health or life of the individual being hazed.
            An individual cannot consent to being hazed; a victim’s voluntary or willful participation in hazing activities will not be considered evidence that a violation of this policy did not occur.Section 18.2-56 of the Code of Virginia declares hazing illegal, establishes conditions for civil and criminal liability, and outlines the duties of the university when a student has been found guilty of hazing in civil or criminal court.<br>
            
            It is hereby incorporated as part of this constitution and will serve as a guide for action by the university and “The Board Game Club” if there is an instance of hazing by this organization or any of the members of this organization.  It will be the duty of the officers of “The Board Game Club” to educate the membership of this policy.<br>
            
            
            
            Article IX - Amendments<br>
            Amendments to this constitution must be submitted in writing at a regular meeting of the organization. Said amendment(s) will be voted on at a subsequent meeting. In order to adopt the amendment, a vote of 2/3 of the general membership is necessary and 2/3 of the executive team.<br>
             
            Article X - Ratification<br>
            This constitution shall become effective upon approval by a ¾ vote of the membership. Ratified constitutions must be submitted to the Student Activities & Involvement office within 10 days for final approval.
